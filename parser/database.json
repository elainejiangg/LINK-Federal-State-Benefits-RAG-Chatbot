You live in Massachusetts, You or someone in your family are a U.S. citizen or an eligible immigrant, and Your income is below the TAFDC limits. Your family's gross income must be under the income limit. (Gross income is the amount before things like taxes are taken out.) The income limit is based on your family size and the type of housing you live in. There are different rules if you are a teen parent under age 18 living with your parent(s). How do I know if my family\u2019s income is below the TAFDC limit? Add up all income before taxes or other deductions. Do not count income of a foster child or someone who gets SSI. If you are working, subtract $200 from your monthly gross earnings. Then, if you got TAFDC in the last 4 months, subtract half of the rest of your gross earnings. These are deductions.
