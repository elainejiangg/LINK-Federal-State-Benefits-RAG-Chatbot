https://dtaconnect.eohhs.mass.gov/ 
Eligibility:
To be eligible, an individual must: 
Have children 18 or younger,  
Are pregnant and are due in less than 4 months; if you are under age 20 you may be eligible at any stage of pregnancy, and/or
Are a caregiver for a child you are related to but who is not your biological or adopted child. As a caregiver, you can apply for TAFDC for yourself and the child(ren) or only the child(ren) in your care. If you apply only for the child(ren) DTA will not look at your income when you apply, even though the application is in your name. If the child in your case has income, that may affect eligibility.
You live in Massachusetts,
You or someone in your family are a U.S. citizen or an eligible immigrant, and
Your income is below the TAFDC limits. Your family's gross income must be under the income limit. (Gross income is the amount before things like taxes are taken out.) 
The income limit is based on your family size and the type of housing you live in.
There are different rules if you are a teen parent under age 18 living with your parent(s).
How do I know if my family’s income is below the TAFDC limit?
Add up all income before taxes or other deductions. Do not count income of a foster child or someone who gets SSI. 
If you are working, subtract $200 from your monthly gross earnings. Then, if you got TAFDC in the last 4 months, subtract half of the rest of your gross earnings. These are deductions. 
If you pay for child care, tell DTA during your application interview. We may be able to subtract more of your earnings.

Child Support rules for TAFDC: Every child who gets TAFDC must have a child support case unless they live with both parents. But, you may not have to apply for child support for a child if you have experienced domestic violence or have safety concerns.  Tell us if you are worried about this.

If you do not already have a child support order, DTA will connect you to the Department of Revenue (DOR). DOR can help you establish paternity and get a child support order.

The state of Massachusetts must keep any child support paid for children who get TAFDC. If a child’s parent (who does not live with the child) pays child support while you get TAFDC, you will get the first $50 each month. This is in addition to TAFDC.

Can DTA help connect me to employment and training services?

DTA will connect all applicants over 18 who can work to JobQuest - the online system connecting people to the MassHire Career Center network. Some applicants must register as part of their TAFDC application.

You can register now for access to free tools and resources to support your career pathway. DTA can also help you register after you apply. Learn more and register here.

Disability accommodation: If you have a disability or health problem that makes it hard for you to do something DTA asks, you can ask for help. This is called an accommodation. If you need assistance, you can contact your case manager or call the DTA Assistance line to be connected to a Client Assistance Coordinator.

Safety concerns or other issues because of domestic violence: If you are dealing with the impacts of domestic violence, DTA can help. The Domestic Violence (DV) Unit can help address safety concerns and other impacts of domestic violence. Find your local DV specialist. If it is an emergency or after hours, call SAFELINK at (877) 785‐2020.

Limitations:
For most families, benefits are only available for 24 out of every 60 months (i.e. 2 out of 5 years), but there are exceptions to the rule for some recipients. The adult recipient of TAFDC can be working and still receive these benefits.

Immigrants: Many immigrants who legally entered the country after 8/22/96 face a five year wait before becoming eligible (but not veterans, refugees, asylees and some others).
